This visualization helps identify seasonal trends, peak selling periods, and months where tax liabilities might significantly impact net profitability. Understanding these patterns enables the showroom to plan for tax obligations and implement strategies to maximize profits during high-performing months.

2. Sum of Profit and Sum of Tax by Month (Stacked Column Chart):
   - Visualization: A stacked column chart was used to illustrate the sum of profit and tax for each month.
